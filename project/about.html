<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<img class="pic" src="mission.jpg" height="150px">
<p>Our mission is clear - to bridge the gap between abundance and scarcity. We recognize that in a land teeming with diverse cultures and traditions, there is an unshakable bond that ties us all together: our love for our people and our desire to see them thrive. We aim to turn this shared sentiment into action, one meal at a time.
</p>


<h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
<img class="pic" src="inspiration.jpg" height="150px">
<p>Our journey began with a simple idea: that no one in our great nation should go to bed hungry. Inspired by the ancient Indian philosophy of "Atithi Devo Bhava" (The guest is God), we believe in treating every individual with the dignity and respect they deserve. We are fueled by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, who reminded us that "there are people in the world so hungry that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread.
</p>


<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<img class="pic" src="approch.jpg" height="150px">
<p>Feed Bharat operates on a simple principle: collect excess food from those who have it and distribute it to those who need it. We partner with restaurants, caterers, and generous individuals to rescue surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. Through a well-organized network of volunteers and community organizations, we ensure that this rescued food reaches the hungry and needy.

</p>

<h2>Transparency and Accountability</h2>
<img class="pic" src="accountablity.webp" height="150px">
<p>We hold ourselves to the highest standards of transparency and accountability. We believe that trust is the cornerstone of any charitable endeavor, and we are committed to keeping our donors, supporters, and beneficiaries fully informed about our activities and impact.
</p>


<h2>Our Vision for the Future</h2>
<img class="pic" src="vision.webp" height="150px">
<p>Our vision is a Bharat where no one sleeps hungry, where every child can go to school with a full stomach, and where the elderly are not forgotten. We aspire to expand our reach to every corner of the nation, ensuring that our mission becomes a reality for millions more.
</p>

<h2>Join Us in Our Journey</h2>
<img class="pic" src="joinus.webp" height="150px">
